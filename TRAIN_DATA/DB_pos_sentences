Valdecoxib_ddi|P|glyburide|valdecoxib|Because changes in glucose concentrations with valdecoxib coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL , dose adjustment for glyburide -LRB- 5 mg QD and 10 mg BID -RRB- with valdecoxib coadministration -LRB- up to 40 mg QD -RRB- is not indicated . 
Valdecoxib_ddi|P|valdecoxib|omeprazole|Coadministration with valdecoxib increased exposure of omeprazole -LRB- AUC -RRB- by 46 %. 
Valdecoxib_ddi|P|valdecoxib|ortho-novum|Coadministration of valdecoxib and Ortho-Novum 1/35 increased the exposure of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by 20 % and 34 % , respectively .
